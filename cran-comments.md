## Notes

- No notes or warnings.

- This release fixes startup messages by using `packageStartupMessage()`

- This package has extra, optional functionality that requires the user to install PhantomJS.  Although PhantomJS is no longer part of Debian, the compiled binaries are available for Linux, Mac OS as well as Windows.  This is only necessary if the user wants to render `nomnoml` diagrams as png images in R Markdown - but is not necessary for SVG images in R Markdown.
